## Scheduling Ontology Network (SROnet)

SROnet allows the formalization and semantic integration of the different applications that support production planning, scheduling, and control in batch process industries. This network contains local ontologies that formalize:

1.the vocabulary of the different information sources/destinations associated with the scheduling activities, and 

2.a core ontology specifying a common vocabulary referred as Schedule Reference Ontology (SRO),
 
 
SRO plays an important role in the proposed network because it formalizes the main concepts related to industrial scheduling activities, to which other concepts belonging to the local ontologies have to map in order to semantically interoperate.

Given the fact that there are dissimilar approaches to solving the scheduling problem, this proposal is flexible enough to accommodate different local ontologies that formalize diverse information sources.
The ontologies that have been implemented are the following:

-[SRO](https://github.com/mvegetti/Scheduling-Ontology-Network-/blob/master/sro_doc)
-[RTNO](https://github.com/mvegetti/Scheduling-Ontology-Network-/blob/master/rtno_doc)
-[ISA88O] (https://github.com/mvegetti/Scheduling-Ontology-Network-/blob/master/isa88o_doc)
